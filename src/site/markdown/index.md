# Key stores

A key store keeps security data use in authentication. While there is a bit of complexity about how they are created and used, in the current version of the project all that matters is that they are used for secure communications, for example when setting up security in a SOAP web service.

## Using the project

The project is just meant to create test key stores, not ones for production use.

To create new keystores run the KeyStoreGenerator class.
